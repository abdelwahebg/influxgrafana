Verify that no Docker containers are currently running

    docker ps

Should only display

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

# Using InfluxDb
Start a shell inside Influxdb container by

    docker-compose exec influxdb influx


Use commands from https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.5/introduction/getting-started/
to 

1. Create a new database
2. Use that database
3. Write some data into the database
4. Read some data from database

After done, close the influxdb prompt by commanding ```exit```

Start our data loggers by

    docker-compose up -d --build stock-logger telegraf

Start the influx prompt again with

    docker-compose exec influxdb influx

You should be able to see some data being logged by commanding

    USE data
    SELECT * FROM stocks LIMIT 10
